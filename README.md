# subway-app

this app will tell me when subways are near my stop

i want to add a feature that can show me multiple stops, this way i can
plan on what route i would prefer to take that day

i want a feature that tells me "leave in 5 minutes from 'work' and you can
catch the R and transfer to the C with only 3 minutes of wait time inbetween"

this can help me as a commuter make my commutes as quick as possible
this can also take all the mental work out of planning your commute that day


good lead would be to webscrape this app
