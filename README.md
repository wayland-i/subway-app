# subway-app

this app will tell me when subways are near my stop

i want to add a feature that can show me multiple stops, this way i can
plan on what route i would prefer to take that day

i want a feature that tells me "leave in 5 minutes from 'work' and you can
catch the R and transfer to the C with only 3 minutes of wait time inbetween"

this can help me as a commuter make my commutes as quick as possible
this can also take all the mental work out of planning your commute that day
